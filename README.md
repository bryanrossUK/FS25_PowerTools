# POWERTOOLS

[Download](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=303451&title=fs2025)

With the PowerTools menu you have quick and easy access to some "quality of life" features. Especially useful if you are a modder or content creator.

Using a single key/button (default F12) you activate the PowerTools menu. From there you can quickly navigate to the different functions without the need for a mouse or navigating through multiple menus.

## Main Features
- Add/remove money to your farm
- Fill vehicle - supports vehicles with multiple tanks/storage units and accepts any filltype supported by the vehicle *
- Spawn any type of pallet (including production materials like sugar and clothes)
- Spawn any type of bale - supports round/square, all sizes and all types (straw, silage, cotton etc) *
- Spawn tree logs - currently only supports limited number of lengths *
- Toggle super speed, super strength or flight mode
- Quickly save the current game, ether via hotkey or the menu *
- Toggle HUD/interface on/off (now with quick command: hold F1/help menu button for ~1 second)
- Repeat last command
- Open PowerTools menu in alternate mode:
-- Restart and exit to menu uses the "hard reset" method instead of "soft reset"
-- Change UI scale (will be reset on restart, to permanently change the UI scale use the game settings instead)
- A limited PowerTools menu can now be opened when main menu is open as well as when the game is paused
- Additional time scales, hold decrease button (default: 7) to pause time, and hold increase button (default: 8) to enable/disable additional speeds *
- Change field state (crop type, growth stage, ground type etc)

### Notes
1. Features marked with an asterisk (*) isn't available on dedicated servers, only in singleplayer and self-hosted multiplayer.
2. Many of the features requires that you have admin access (to prevent cheating in multiplayer) - in single player everyone is admin though :)
3. To be able to use "Repeat last action" you need to bind a hotkey in the input binding settings
4. The new alternate mode menu uses a separate hotkey (default Right Ctrl + F12)
5. For players with a keyboard that doesn't have the WASD layout, e.g. AZERTY, the key binding for ascending/descending (default: Q/E) in flight mode can be different (e.g. use keys A/E for AZERTY layout)

If you want to report a bug or submit an suggestion, please first check the [list of existing issues](https://github.com/w33zl/FS25_PowerTools/issues) to ensure that you are not adding duplicates (this just consumes my time that could be spent on improving the mods).
